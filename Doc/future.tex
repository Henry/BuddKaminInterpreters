\chapter*{Possible Future Changes}

The following list represents a few of the ideas that occurred to me as I was
developing these interpreters for how things might be done differently.  These
are presented in no particular order.  (Nor as any particularly grave criticism
of the Kamin interpreters - I still think the book as a whole is very good).
\begin{itemize}
    \item The C++ versions of the interpreters have an annoying habit of dumping
    core when an error occurs.  Need to track this down and fix it.
    \item I would remove the while statement from the chapter 2 lisp
    interpreter.  Students who do not have previous experience with Lisp often
    have a difficult time learning to program in a recursive fashion.  For them
    the while statement is a crutch, and without it they would be forced to use
    the more Lisp-like features of the language.
    \item I would add functionals (called operators in APL) to chapter 3.
    Specifically I would make reduction take the function as an argument, and
    add inner and outer product.  This would allow an easier transition to
    functional programming in the next section.
    \item I might be tempted to add a chapter before chapter 3 on Setl.  This is
    another example of a language using large values, and allows a new and
    different problem domain to be discussed (namely logic).
    \item It would be nice to add call/cc to the scheme interpreter, but I don't
    exactly see how to do this right now.  This is not quite as critical now
    that the Prolog interpreter uses continuations for its execution.
    \item I would remove the keyword ``rep'' from the CLU syntax, as it is
    unnecessary and its elimination simplifies the implementation.
\end{itemize}
