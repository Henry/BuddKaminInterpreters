* Documentation =Doc=
*** DONE Complete the replacement of =\begin{lstlisting}= for =\lstinputlisting=
    CLOSED: [2014-01-19 Sun 17:35]
    such that all code listings are imported directly from the source files in
    =Src=.  See =chap.tex= for an example of what needs to be done.  Note that
    using the annotation syntax =/// <lable name>= the Makefile generates the
    list of first and last line numbers automatically.  See =Src/main.C= for an
    example.
*** TODO Rename files to correspond to the languages rather than the chapters
    Alternatively combine the language name and the chapter number /e.g./ "chap2_lisp.tex"

* Source code =Src=
*** DONE Complete the conversion of member functions and arguments to =const=
    CLOSED: [2014-01-19 Sun 17:36]
    where appropriate.  Once this is done the =const_cast= statements can be
    removed.
*** TODO Introduce a =namespace=
    /e.g./ =Kamin= or =Budd= or =BuddKamin=.
*** TODO Update =Makefile= adding proper dependency checking.
*** DONE Rename files to correspond to the languages rather than the chapters.
    CLOSED: [2014-01-14 Tue 22:54]
*** TODO Replace use of =char*= with C++ =std::string=
*** TODO Replace C IO functions with C++ =std::iostream= operators.
*** TODO Complete updating Kamin test codes for the Budd versions of the intepreters
*** TODO Use valgrind to test for memory leaks

* Release =GitHub=
*** TODO When the code is updated release on GitHub
